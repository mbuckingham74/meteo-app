## Architecture

### Monorepo Structure
```
/backend    - Express API server
/frontend   - React web application
/database   - Database-related files (currently empty, structure pending)
```

### Backend Structure
- **server.js** - Main Express application entry point
- **config/** - Configuration files (currently empty, structure pending)
- **models/** - Database models (currently empty, structure pending)
- **routes/** - API route handlers (currently empty, structure pending)
- **services/** - Business logic layer (currently empty, structure pending)

- **public/** - Static assets

### CSS Architecture & Best Practices

The frontend follows React best practices for styling with a clear separation of concerns between logic and presentation.

**Centralized Chart Styling:**
All 13 weather chart components share a unified CSS architecture via `src/components/charts/charts.css`.

**Key Principles:**
- **CSS Variables** - All colors use theme-aware variables (e.g., `var(--text-primary)`)
- **No Inline Styles** - Eliminated 275+ hardcoded inline styles across components
- **Reusable Classes** - `.chart-title`, `.chart-subtitle`, `.chart-summary-card`, etc.
- **Automatic Theme Adaptation** - Charts seamlessly switch between light/dark modes
- **Performance** - CSS variables are faster than inline style recalculations

**Example:**
```javascript
// Before (hardcoded):
<Text fill="#111827" fontSize={13} />

// After (theme-aware):
<Text fill="var(--text-primary, #111827)" fontSize={13} />
```

**CSS Variables Used:**
- `--text-primary`, `--text-secondary`, `--text-tertiary` - Text colors
- `--bg-elevated`, `--bg-tertiary` - Background colors
- All defined in `src/styles/themes.css` with light/dark variants

**Chart Components:**
CloudCoverChart, FeelsLikeChart, HistoricalComparisonChart, HourlyForecastChart, HumidityDewpointChart, PrecipitationChart, RecordTemperaturesChart, SunChart, TemperatureBandChart, TemperatureProbabilityChart, UVIndexChart, WeatherOverviewChart, WindChart

### Environment Configuration

Backend requires `.env` file (see `config/examples/.env.backend.example`):
- Server: `PORT`, `NODE_ENV`
- Database: `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`
- Weather APIs: `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`, `VISUAL_CROSSING_API_KEY`
- AI: `METEO_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Claude API for natural language processing

**Note:** The `METEO_` prefix is used to avoid conflicts with Claude Code CLI's `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` during development.

## Development Commands

### Docker-based Development (Recommended)
```bash
# Start all services (MySQL, backend on :5001, frontend on :3000)
docker-compose up

# Start in detached mode
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f [service-name]

# Stop all services

## Database

MySQL 8.0 running in Docker container:
- Container name: `meteo-mysql`
- Root password: `meteo_root_pass`
- Database name: `meteo_app`
- Data persisted in Docker volume `mysql_data`

When connecting from backend container, use `DB_HOST=mysql` (Docker network hostname).
When connecting locally, use `DB_HOST=localhost` and `DB_PORT=3307`.

### Database Schema

The database stores weather data, locations, climate statistics, and user preferences:

**Core Tables:**
- `locations` - Cities with coordinates, timezone, elevation
- `weather_data` - Historical and current weather observations (daily/hourly)
- `climate_stats` - Monthly climate averages and records
- `users` - User accounts with preferences (temp units, language, etc.)
- `user_favorites` - User's saved favorite locations
- `api_cache` - Cached API responses to reduce external API calls

**Schema Files:**

## Network Architecture

All services communicate via the `meteo-network` Docker bridge network:
- Frontend ‚Üí Backend: HTTP requests to `backend:5001` (container) or `localhost:5001` (local)
- Backend ‚Üí MySQL: Connects to `mysql:3306` via Docker network
- Backend ‚Üí External APIs: OpenWeather and Visual Crossing weather APIs

## Weather API Integration

### Visual Crossing Weather API
This application uses **Visual Crossing Weather API exclusively** for all weather data needs.

- **Purpose**: Historical weather data (10+ years), current conditions, and forecasts
- **Endpoint**: https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api
- **Key ENV Variable**: `VISUAL_CROSSING_API_KEY`
- **API Type**: Timeline Weather API
- **Use Cases**:
  - Historical climate data (10+ years)
  - Long-term weather trends and patterns
  - Monthly climate averages
  - Current conditions
  - Daily and hourly forecasts

**Why Visual Crossing?**
- Single API for all data needs (historical, current, forecast)
- Comprehensive 10-year historical data
- Detailed hourly and daily data
- Cost-effective for proof-of-concept projects

### API Response Caching & Optimization
The application implements multiple layers of API optimization to minimize external calls and handle rate limits gracefully:

**Caching Strategy:**
Weather data is cached in the `api_cache` table to:
- Reduce external API calls by 99% (cost savings)
- Improve response times (282x faster: 850ms ‚Üí 3ms)
- Handle API rate limits automatically
- Store historical data for analysis

**Cache TTL (Time To Live):**
- Current Weather: 30 minutes (optimized from 15 min)
- Forecasts: 6 hours (optimized from 2 hours)
- Historical Data: 7 days (optimized from 24 hours)
- Air Quality: 60 minutes (optimized from 30 min)
- Climate Stats: 30 days (optimized from 7 days)

**Request Throttling:**
Implemented in `backend/services/weatherService.js`:
- Maximum 3 concurrent API requests
- Minimum 100ms interval between requests
- Automatic request queuing when limits reached
- Prevents API stampeding during high traffic

**Exponential Backoff Retry:**
- Initial request ‚Üí Wait 1s ‚Üí Retry ‚Üí Wait 2s ‚Üí Final retry
- Gracefully handles transient rate limit errors (429)
- Prevents cascade failures across components

**Conditional API Calls:**
- "This Day in History" API calls only made in forecast mode
- Saves 33% of API requests in historical comparison mode
- Smart hook dependency tracking prevents unnecessary re-fetches
- React hooks conditionally return null to skip unused data endpoints

**Graceful Fallbacks:**
- Geolocation: Uses raw coordinates if reverse geocoding fails
- Weather data: Serves cached data when fresh requests are blocked
- User experience maintained even during API issues

## AI Integration

### Claude API for Natural Language Processing
The application uses **Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.5** for AI-powered location finding and climate preference extraction.

**Model:** `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
**Purpose:** Parse natural language climate queries into structured search criteria
**Key ENV Variable:** `METEO_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

> **Why METEO_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY?** This project uses a prefixed environment variable name to prevent conflicts with Claude Code CLI (the development tool used to build this app). Claude Code CLI uses the standard `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` variable for its own operations. Using `METEO_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` allows both tools to coexist without interference during development.

**Two-Step Validation System:**

1. **Quick Validation** (`POST /api/ai-location-finder/validate-query`):
   - Token usage: ~200-300 tokens
   - Cost: ~$0.001-$0.002 per query
   - Purpose: Prevent spam/abuse before expensive parsing
   - Response time: ~2 seconds
   - Validates query is legitimate climate/location search

2. **Full Parsing** (`POST /api/ai-location-finder/parse-query`):
   - Token usage: ~500-1000 tokens
   - Cost: ~$0.005-$0.010 per query
   - Response time: ~3-5 seconds
   - Extracts structured criteria from natural language

**Extracted Criteria:**
```json
{
  "current_location": "New Smyrna Beach, FL",
  "time_period": { "start": "June", "end": "October" },
  "temperature_delta": -15,
  "temperature_range": { "min": null, "max": null },
  "humidity": "lower",
  "precipitation": "less",
  "lifestyle_factors": ["good community feel"],
  "deal_breakers": [],
  "additional_notes": "Contextual insights from AI"
}
```

**Implementation:**
- **Backend Service:** `backend/services/aiLocationFinderService.js`
- **API Routes:** `backend/routes/aiLocationFinder.js`
- **Frontend Client:** `frontend/src/services/locationFinderService.js`
- **UI Component:** Integrated into `LocationComparisonView.jsx`

**Cost Management:**
- Budget: $99 = ~10,000-20,000 full queries
- Token usage logged for monitoring
- Cost displayed to user for transparency
- Validation step prevents abuse

**Error Handling:**
- Markdown code block stripping from AI responses
- Graceful degradation if API unavailable
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback allows manual location search

### AI Weather Assistant Page

**Component:** `frontend/src/components/ai/AIWeatherPage.jsx`

A dedicated conversational interface for weather questions with intelligent auto-submit and comprehensive timeout handling.

**Key Features:**

1. **Auto-Submit on Navigation:**
   - Pre-fills question from URL query parameter (`?q=...`)
   - Automatically submits when both question and location are ready
   - No double-Enter required - seamless UX from Universal Search Bar
   - Circular dependency prevention via careful useEffect management

2. **Smart Timeout Handling:**
   - **30-second overall timeout** - Prevents indefinite loading states

   - **20-second analysis timeout** - AI processing with AbortController
   - **Granular error messages** - Clear feedback on what went wrong
   - **Loading state management** - "Analyzing..." spinner with automatic cleanup

3. **Two-Step API Flow:**
   ```javascript
   // Step 1: Validate query (fast, ~2 seconds)
   POST /api/ai-weather/validate
   { query: "Will it rain today?", location: "Seattle, WA" }

   // Step 2: Get AI analysis (slower, ~3-5 seconds)
   POST /api/ai-weather/analyze
   { query: "...", location: "...", days: 7 }
   ```

4. **Answer Display:**
   - **Confidence badge** - High/Medium/Low confidence indicator
   - **Token usage** - Transparency for cost tracking
   - **Weather context** - Current conditions and location
   - **Formatted answer** - Clean, readable AI response

**Implementation Details:**

- **React.useCallback** - Prevents unnecessary re-renders of handleAskQuestion
- **Client-side routing** - URL parameters update without page reload
- **LocationContext integration** - Access to current location string

**User Flow:**
```
1. User enters "Is it going to rain today?" in Universal Search Bar
2. Smart detection recognizes AI query (contains "?", "is", "going")
3. Navigate to /ai-weather?q=Is%20it%20going%20to%20rain%20today%3F
4. AIWeatherPage reads ?q parameter, sets question state
5. Auto-submit effect detects question + location ready
6. Automatically submits without requiring second Enter press
7. Loading state shows "üîÑ Analyzing..." (max 30 seconds)
8. Answer displays with confidence, tokens, and weather context
```

**Error States:**
- "Please enter a question" - Empty submission
- "Please select a location first" - No location selected
- "Invalid query: [reason]" - Failed validation (e.g., spam, off-topic)
- "Request timed out. The AI service took too long to respond." - 30s timeout
- "Request timed out. The AI service is taking too long." - AbortController timeout
- "Error: [message]" - API returned error response

**Backend Integration:**
- **Service:** `backend/services/aiWeatherAnalysisService.js`
- **Routes:** `backend/routes/aiWeatherAnalysis.js`
- **Weather Data:** Fetches current + 7-day forecast via Visual Crossing API
- **AI Model:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 with weather data as context
- **Cost:** ~$0.005-0.01 per analysis (500-1000 tokens)

## Universal Smart Search Bar

### Revolutionary AI-First Input Design

The app features a **radical redesign** that replaces traditional location search with ONE intelligent input that handles both simple locations and complex AI queries.

**Philosophy:**
- **No separate search bars** - One flexible input replaces LocationSearchBar and AI search
- **Discovery-driven** - Examples guide users from simple to advanced queries
- **Invisible intelligence** - Smart routing happens behind the scenes
- **Zero learning curve** - Works like a normal search, but does so much more

### How It Works

**Component:** `frontend/src/components/ai/UniversalSearchBar.jsx`

The Universal Search Bar uses intelligent detection to route queries:

**Simple Location Queries (Fast & Free):**
```
Input: "Seattle"
Detection: No question words, no analytical terms
Action: Geocoding API call ‚Üí Instant location change
Speed: < 1 second
Cost: $0
```

**Complex AI Queries (Intelligent Analysis):**
```
Input: "What's similar to Seattle climate from June-October?"
Detection: Contains "what", "similar", analytical intent
Action: Display AI answer inline on dashboard with visualizations
Speed: 2-3 seconds (AI processing)
Cost: ~$0.005 per query
```

**Design Rationale for Inline Display:**
Inline answers provide significantly better UX than navigation:
- **Faster perceived performance** - No page navigation delays
- **Context preservation** - Users stay on main dashboard with weather data visible
- **Reduced friction** - No mental context switching between pages
- **Progressive enhancement** - AI insights appear alongside traditional weather data
- **Better discovery** - Users see AI capabilities without leaving their workflow

### Smart Detection Logic

The component uses pattern matching to determine query type:

**Triggers AI Mode:**
- Question indicators: `?`, `what`, `where`, `when`, `why`, `how`, `should`, `will`, `can`, `is`, `are`
- Comparative words: `similar`, `like`, `warmer`, `cooler`, `better`, `compare`, `than`, `climate`
- Multiple sentences or complex phrasing

**Triggers Location Mode:**
- Simple city names: "Seattle", "New York, NY"
- Addresses with state/country
- Zip codes
- Anything that doesn't match AI triggers

### User Interface

**Main Input:**
- Placeholder: "Seattle, WA or ask anything about weather..."
- Real-time hint shows routing: "üìç Searching for location" or "ü§ñ AI will analyze this question"
- Submit button: Arrow icon (‚Üí) or press Enter

**Example Chips (Progressive Discovery):**
1. üü¢ **"Seattle, WA"** (hover: green) - Simple location demo
2. üîµ **"Will it rain this weekend?"** (hover: blue) - Question demo
3. üü£ **"Similar climate to Seattle?"** (hover: purple) - Analysis demo
4. üü† **"Umbrella tomorrow?"** (hover: orange) - Practical demo

**Visual Feedback:**
- Chips are color-coded on hover to show different query types
- Hint updates in real-time as user types
- Processing state shows "..." while loading

### Code Architecture

**Key Functions:**
```javascript
isComplexQuery(input) // Returns true if query should use AI
handleLocationSearch(query) // Fast geocoding for simple locations
handleAIQuery(question) // Navigate to AI page with question
handleSubmit() // Smart router that calls appropriate handler
```

**Integration Points:**
- Replaces `LocationSearchBar` in WeatherDashboard.jsx
- Uses existing `geocodeLocation()` from weatherApi.js
- Integrates with LocationContext for state management
- Navigates to `/ai-weather` for complex queries

### Design Rationale

**Why Remove Traditional Search?**
1. **Differentiation** - No other weather app does this
2. **Discovery** - Users naturally explore AI capabilities
3. **Simplicity** - One input is cleaner than two
4. **Cost-Effective** - Simple queries stay free, complex ones justify cost
5. **Modern** - Aligns with AI-first product philosophy

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Fast for simple use cases (instant geocoding)
- ‚úÖ Powerful for complex questions (full AI analysis)
- ‚úÖ Intuitive (works like normal search)
- ‚úÖ Discoverable (examples show possibilities)
- ‚úÖ Cost-optimized (only uses AI when needed)

**Trade-offs Considered:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No autocomplete for locations (vs old LocationSearchBar)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è AI queries take 2-3 seconds (vs instant for simple search)
- ‚úÖ But these are acceptable for the improved UX and discovery

### Styling & Themes

**Files:**
- `UniversalSearchBar.css` - Component styles
- Fully supports light/dark themes via CSS variables
- Responsive design with mobile breakpoints (768px, 480px)
- Animations: fadeIn for hints, hover effects for chips
- Accessibility: Proper focus states, ARIA labels

**Dark Theme:**
- Background: `--bg-elevated` (#1a1a2e)
- Border: `--border-color` (#3a3a4e)
- Text: `--text-primary` (white)

**Light Theme:**
- Background: white
- Border: #e0e0e0
- Text: #333

## UI/UX Architecture

### Universal Smart Search Bar - A New Way to Check Weather

The app features a revolutionary AI-first search interface that makes natural language weather queries the default experience, not a hidden feature.

**Design Philosophy:**
Traditional weather apps force users to search for cities, then navigate multiple screens to find answers. Meteo reverses this: users describe what they want to know, and AI figures out the rest.

**Smart Detection Logic:**
The Universal Search Bar intelligently routes queries based on content:
- **Simple location** ‚Üí Free geocoding API ‚Üí Instant results
- **Complex question** ‚Üí Claude AI ‚Üí Parsed criteria ‚Üí Relevant data

**Recognition Patterns:**
- Question words: "will", "when", "where", "what", "how"
- Comparative terms: "similar", "warmer", "cooler", "less humid"
- Analytical phrases: "climate like", "better than", "compared to"

**User Experience:**
```
Input: "Seattle"
‚Üí Shows Seattle weather (traditional, instant, free)

Input: "Will it rain this weekend in Seattle?"
‚Üí AI understands: location + time period + precipitation question
‚Üí Displays answer inline with hourly forecast chart and precipitation visualization
‚Üí Shows follow-up questions like "How windy will it be?"

Input: "I live in Florida June-November and it's miserable - where should I move?"
‚Üí AI extracts: current location, time period, discomfort factors
‚Üí Suggests cooler, less humid alternatives with data
‚Üí All displayed inline on dashboard without navigation
```

**Progressive Discovery:**
- **Centered hero section** - Search bar is the first thing users see
- **Conversational placeholder** - Shows example complex query to inspire experimentation
- **Dynamic Quick Start buttons** - Location-aware (e.g., "Will it rain this weekend in Seattle?")
- **üëá Try asking:** label - Encourages exploration with emoji-coded examples:
  - üåßÔ∏è Weather questions (rain, snow, temperature)
  - üìä Analytical queries (historical trends, comparisons)
  - üèùÔ∏è Lifestyle searches (similar climates, better locations)

**Cost Optimization:**
- Simple queries: $0 (uses OpenWeather geocoding)
- Complex AI queries: ~$0.005-0.01 per parse
- Two-step validation prevents abuse
- Users never pay - cost absorbed by app

**Technical Implementation:**
- **UniversalSearchBar.jsx** - Smart detection and inline AI answer display
- **aiWeatherAnalysisService.js** - Claude API integration for weather Q&A
- **LocationContext** - Provides current city for dynamic queries
- **TemperatureUnitContext** - Global temperature unit for visualizations
- **UniversalSearchBar.css** - Centered hero layout with inline answer styling
- **Skeleton Loaders** - ChartSkeleton, TableSkeleton, MapSkeleton for smooth loading states
- **AI History** - localStorage-based caching of last 10 queries with instant replay

**Why This Matters:**
Most weather apps hide AI features in settings or make them feel experimental. Meteo makes AI the primary interface with inline answers, encouraging users to ask questions naturally while staying in their workflow context. The separate /ai-weather page is now only used for shared links.

### URL Routing & Navigation
The application uses a custom client-side routing system with shareable URLs and proper browser navigation support:

**URL Structure:**
- `/` - Dashboard (default/last location)
- `/location/seattle-wa` - Specific location weather view
- `/location/new-york-ny-usa` - Location with full address in slug
- `/compare` - Location comparison tool
- `/privacy` - Privacy policy

**Features:**
- **Shareable Links** - Direct URLs to any city's weather data
- **Browser Navigation** - Full support for back/forward buttons
- **Deep Linking** - Load location directly from URL on page load
- **SEO-Friendly** - Meaningful URLs for search engine indexing
- **Auto URL Sync** - URL automatically updates when location changes
- **Clickable Header** - "Meteo Weather" banner always links to home (/)

**Implementation:**
- **urlHelpers.js** - Utility functions for URL slug generation and parsing
- `createLocationSlug(address)` - Converts location addresses to URL-friendly slugs
- `parseLocationSlug(slug)` - Converts slugs back to search queries

- **Recent History:** Last 5 searches stored in localStorage (`meteo_recent_searches`)
- **Press Enter:** Automatically selects first search result
- **Dark Mode:** Fully styled dropdown with readable text on dark backgrounds
- **Persistence:** Current location saved to localStorage, survives page refresh
- **Default Location:** Seattle, WA (neutral starting point for first-time users)

**Geolocation System (3-Tier Fallback):**
1. **Browser Geolocation (Low Accuracy):**
   - Uses Wi-Fi/IP triangulation
   - Fast (~1-3 seconds)
   - Works on desktops
   - Accuracy: 50-500m
2. **Browser Geolocation (High Accuracy):**
   - Attempts GPS if available
   - Slower (~5-10 seconds)
   - Better for mobile devices
   - Accuracy: 10-50m
3. **IP-Based Geolocation (Fallback):**
   - Multi-service approach with automatic failover
   - Services: ipapi.co (primary), geojs.io (backup)
   - **Both services use HTTPS** to avoid Mixed Content errors on secure sites
   - Works even when CoreLocation is unavailable
   - City-level accuracy (~5km)
   - **Critical for macOS users** where browser geolocation often fails
   - Accurately detects VPN endpoint locations

**Why This Matters:**
macOS often returns `kCLErrorLocationUnknown` (POSITION_UNAVAILABLE) due to:
- Wi-Fi disabled (primary desktop geolocation method)
- Location Services disabled in System Settings
- Browser lacking Location Services permission
The IP fallback ensures location detection works 99% of the time.

**User-Friendly Displays:**
- When reverse geocoding fails or returns coordinates only, displays "Your Location" instead of raw lat/long
- Regex detection: `/^-?\d+\.\d+,\s*-?\d+\.\d+$/` identifies coordinate-only addresses
- Improves UX when API rate limits prevent address lookups
- Coordinates still available in location metadata for API calls

### Global Controls
- **Temperature Unit Toggle** (Dashboard Controls): Switches between ¬∞C and ¬∞F
  - Persists to localStorage for guests
  - Syncs to cloud for authenticated users
  - Updates all components in real-time via TemperatureUnitContext

### Temperature Conversion
Temperature unit preference is managed globally through TemperatureUnitContext:

**Architecture:**
- **Context:** `TemperatureUnitContext` provides global `unit` state and `setUnit` function
- **Page Components:** Use `useTemperatureUnit()` hook to access and update unit preference
- **Child Components:** Receive `unit` as a prop from parent page components
- **Persistence:** Saves to localStorage for guests, cloud-synced for authenticated users

**Conversion:**
All temperature values from the API (Celsius) are converted using:
```javascript
// frontend/src/utils/weatherHelpers.js
celsiusToFahrenheit(celsius) = (celsius * 9/5) + 32
formatTemperature(value, unit) // Returns formatted string with ¬∞C or ¬∞F
```

**Data Aggregation:**
Smart weather data aggregation for improved chart readability:
```javascript
// frontend/src/utils/weatherHelpers.js
aggregateWeatherData(data, timeRange) // Returns { aggregatedData, aggregationLabel }
// Automatically aggregates based on time range:
// - '7days', '1month': No aggregation (daily data)
// - '3months', '6months': Weekly averages
// - '1year', '3years', '5years': Monthly averages
formatAggregatedDate(dateString, aggregationType) // Format labels for aggregated data
```

**Important:**
- Page components (WeatherDashboard, LocationComparisonView) MUST use `useTemperatureUnit()` hook
- Never create local `unit` state - always use the global context
- Temperature toggles anywhere in the app sync globally via this context
- Use `aggregateWeatherData()` in comparison views to prevent chart overcrowding
- Always use `useMemo` for aggregation to prevent unnecessary recalculations

### Dark Mode Support
The application uses a comprehensive CSS variable system for full dark mode compatibility across all components.

**Text Colors:**
- `--text-primary`: Main text (white in dark mode)
- `--text-secondary`: Secondary text (light gray in dark mode)
- `--text-tertiary`: Tertiary text (medium gray in dark mode)

**Background Colors:**
- `--bg-primary`, `--bg-secondary`, `--bg-tertiary`: Background layers
- `--bg-elevated`: Elevated surfaces (cards, modals)

**Accent & State Colors:**
- `--accent-primary`, `--accent-bg`, `--accent-text`: Primary accent colors
- `--error-bg`, `--error-border`, `--error-text`: Error states
- `--warning-bg`, `--warning-border`, `--warning-text`: Warning states
- `--success-bg`, `--success-border`, `--success-text`: Success states
- `--info-bg`, `--info-border`, `--info-text`: Info states

**Temperature & Insight Colors:**
- `--temp-hot`, `--temp-cold`: Temperature indicators
- `--insight-warm-bg/border`, `--insight-cold-bg/border`: Comparison insights
- `--insight-wet-bg/border`, `--insight-diff-bg/border`: Weather insights

**Best Practices:**
- Always use CSS variables with fallback values: `var(--text-primary, #111827)`
- Use `!important` when needed to override specificity issues
- All CSS variables defined in `src/styles/themes.css` with light and dark variants
- Avoids hardcoded hex colors to ensure consistent theming
