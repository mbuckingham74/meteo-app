```

### Post Body

**Short Version (Recommended for HN):**
```
I built Meteo, a self-hosted weather dashboard that goes beyond basic forecasts.

Key features:
‚Ä¢ AI-powered location finder - "Find me somewhere 15¬∞F cooler with less humidity"
‚Ä¢ Interactive radar map with real historical precipitation data (RainViewer)
‚Ä¢ 10-year climate analysis and comparison tools
‚Ä¢ Weather alerts overlay with animated markers
‚Ä¢ Runs on a $6/month VPS (Docker, React, Node.js, MySQL)

The app uses Visual Crossing for historical data, which gives you actual 10-year weather patterns instead of just forecasts. The AI location finder uses Claude to parse natural language queries into structured search criteria.

It's inspired by Weather Spark but fully self-hostable. Most APIs have generous free tiers (1000 requests/day), so it costs $0/month for personal use.

Live demo: https://meteo-beta.tachyonfuture.com
GitHub: https://github.com/mbuckingham74/meteo-app

Built this because I wanted a Weather Spark alternative I could self-host and customize. Happy to answer questions!
```

**Longer Version (If Comments Ask for Details):**
```
I started this project because I was frustrated with basic weather apps that only show forecasts. I wanted something that could:

1. Show me 10 years of historical climate data, not just predictions
2. Let me compare multiple cities side-by-side
3. Use AI to help me find places with specific climate preferences
4. Show real precipitation radar, not just current conditions
5. Be self-hostable so I own my data

Technical stack:
- Frontend: React 19 with context providers for global state
- Backend: Node.js/Express with aggressive API caching (99% reduction)
- Database: MySQL 8.0 for weather data and user preferences
- AI: Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 for natural language processing
- Deployment: Docker Compose (3 containers)

The AI location finder is pretty cool - you can say things like "I want somewhere 15 degrees cooler from June to October, less humid, not rainy" and it parses that into structured search criteria. Currently just extracts the criteria, but planning to add actual location recommendations.

Caching strategy is key - the app implements:
- Database caching with smart TTLs (30min-30days depending on data type)
- Request throttling (max 3 concurrent API calls)
- Exponential backoff for rate limits
- This reduces API costs from ~$50/month to basically free

The radar map uses RainViewer's free API which gives you real historical radar frames (past 2 hours + 30 min forecast). Much better than static maps.

Challenges:
- Geolocation on macOS is unreliable (implemented IP-based fallback)
- React 19's strict mode causes double-renders (had to optimize hooks)
- Chart performance with 10 years of data (implemented smart aggregation)

Future ideas:
- Push notifications for weather alerts
- Mobile app (React Native)
- Plugin system for custom weather sources
- Social features (share favorite locations)

The whole thing runs great on minimal hardware. My $6/month DigitalOcean droplet handles 10-50 concurrent users with no issues.

### r/docker

**Title:**
```
Built a weather dashboard that runs perfectly in Docker Compose on minimal hardware
```

**Post:**
```
I wanted to share my experience building a full-stack weather app that runs great in Docker with minimal resources.

**Architecture:**
- 3 containers: MySQL 8.0, Node.js backend, React frontend
- Bridge network for inter-container communication
- Volume mounting for development
- Production-ready compose file included

**Resource Usage:**
- RAM: 2-4GB recommended (runs on 1GB in production)
- CPU: 1-2 cores sufficient
- Storage: ~10GB (includes images + database)
- Successfully running on DigitalOcean $6/month droplet

**Cool Docker Features Used:**
- Health checks on all containers
- Conditional service startup (depends_on with health checks)
- Named volumes for data persistence
- Multi-stage builds for production images
- .env file integration for secrets

**Development Workflow:**
```bash
docker-compose up        # Start all services
docker-compose logs -f   # Watch logs
docker-compose down      # Clean shutdown
```

**Production Notes:**
- Separate prod compose file with optimized settings
- Internal network isolation for MySQL
- Nginx Proxy Manager integration
- Automatic restarts configured

The app itself is a weather dashboard with AI features, but from a Docker perspective, it's a good example of a well-structured multi-container setup.

**GitHub:** https://github.com/mbuckingham74/meteo-app
**Live Demo:** https://meteo-beta.tachyonfuture.com

What Docker optimization tips do you all use for production deployments?

### r/reactjs

**Title:**
```
Built a weather dashboard with React 19 - Context patterns, hooks optimization, and chart performance
```

**Post:**
```
I built a comprehensive weather dashboard using React 19 and wanted to share some interesting patterns I used.

**Architecture:**
- 4 Context providers (Auth, Theme, Location, TemperatureUnit)
- Nested context composition in App.js
- Custom hooks for API calls with caching
- Recharts for data visualization (15+ interactive charts)

**Interesting Challenges:**

1. **Global State Management**
   - Used Context API for cross-component state (no Redux)
   - Temperature unit toggle syncs across all components
   - Location context shared between dashboard and comparison views

2. **React 19 Strict Mode**
   - Double-renders in development required careful hook optimization
   - Implemented cleanup functions for all side effects
   - Used useMemo/useCallback strategically

3. **Chart Performance**
   - 10 years of daily data = 3,650+ data points
   - Implemented smart aggregation (daily ‚Üí weekly ‚Üí monthly)
   - Dynamic aggregation based on selected time range
   - Charts stay responsive with proper memoization

4. **Dark Mode**
   - CSS variables system for theming
   - Auto mode detects system preferences
   - All components support both themes including charts

5. **API Integration**
   - Custom service layer with caching
   - Conditional API calls to avoid waste
   - Error boundaries for API failures
   - Loading states with skeletons

**Cool Features:**
- AI-powered location finder (Claude integration)
- Interactive Leaflet map with multiple layers
- Clickable chart views (4 different metric focus modes)
- Recent search history with localStorage
- Geolocation with IP fallback

**Tech Stack:**
- React 19.2.0
- Recharts 3.3.0
- Leaflet 1.9.4 + React-Leaflet 5.0.0
- Create React App (not ejected)

**GitHub:** https://github.com/mbuckingham74/meteo-app
**Live Demo:** https://meteo-beta.tachyonfuture.com/compare

Would love feedback on the context patterns and chart optimization approaches!
