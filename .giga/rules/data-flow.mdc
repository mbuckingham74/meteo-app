## Core Weather Data Flow

1. Weather Data Aggregation (Score: 95)
- Weather service fetches and normalizes data from multiple sources
- Custom caching layer with variable TTL based on data type
- Intelligent data refresh based on weather severity
Path: `backend/services/weatherService.js`

2. Location-Based Data Pipeline (Score: 90)
- Geocoding service processes location queries
- Climate matching algorithms for location recommendations
- Historical pattern analysis with 30-year climate normals
Paths: 
- `backend/services/geocodingService.js`
- `backend/services/climateService.js`

3. AI-Enhanced Data Processing (Score: 85)
- Natural language weather query processing
- Context-aware weather pattern analysis
- Structured criteria extraction from natural queries
Paths:
- `backend/services/aiWeatherAnalysisService.js`
- `backend/services/aiLocationFinderService.js`

## State Management Architecture

1. Weather State Management (Score: 85)
- Custom hooks manage weather data lifecycle
- Intelligent data refresh based on staleness
- Automatic background updates for critical metrics
Path: `frontend/src/hooks/useWeatherData.js`

2. Location Context Management (Score: 80)
- Cloud sync for user favorites
- Location deduplication logic
- Intelligent location matching
Path: `frontend/src/contexts/LocationContext.js`

## Caching Strategy

1. Dynamic Weather Caching (Score: 85)
- Variable TTL based on weather volatility
- Stale-while-revalidate for rapid updates
- Background sync for offline support
Path: `backend/services/cacheService.js`

2. Historical Data Caching (Score: 80)
- Long-term storage for climate normals
- Incremental updates for historical records
- Custom invalidation rules for weather events
Path: `backend/services/climateService.js`

## Real-time Data Flow

1. Weather Alert Processing (Score: 85)
- Severity-based alert prioritization
- Custom alert aggregation logic
- Real-time push notification system
Path: `backend/routes/weather.js`

2. Radar Data Stream (Score: 80)
